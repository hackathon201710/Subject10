**When:** The user open the app:

**Then:** A stack of cards with a image and an yes or no question is asked. The User can swipe left or right in order to eaither dismiss the card or add additional information that can later be used. Once all cards are completed the user shall be informed that the procces is completed. 

**Extra bonus:** Add server integrations to the app in order to send new cards to the user and collect data that the user has added from the client.

## Conclusions

* The Ionic framework that was used in this project were not the most optional framework of choose. The team suggests to switch framework to either an more native based framework or prue HTML5, if this project were to continue. 
* Server integrations could in theory improve the usefulness of the application, however this has not been tested yet. Push Notifications could be used in order to alert the user that new cards are ready to be answered. 
* The app could be linked to other photo apps that push images to a server, that sends out new cards to the app. 
* Could be expanded with any question and inputfield.
